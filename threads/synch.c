	인터럽트 컨텍스트에서 yield를 호출하면 안되는이유
	1. 재진입 문제 : 인터럽트 핸들러는 재진입 불가능하다고 가정하는데, 이는 동일한 인터럽트 핸들러가
		동시에 여러번 호출되어 실행되지 않는다는것임.
		그러나 yield를 호출하면 다른 스레드나 프로세스가 실행될수 있어 동일한 인터럽트 핸들러가 재진입할 수 있는
		상황이 발생할 수 있음.
	2. 스택 문제 : 인터럽트 핸들러는 종종 별도의 스택을 사용하여 실행되는데, yield를 호출하면
		현재 스택 컨텍스트를 변경할 수 있으므로 인터럽트 핸들러가 반환될 때 스택상태에
		문제가 발생할 수 있음.
	3. 우선순위 문제 : 인터럽트는 종종 시스템 내 중요한 사건을 나타내므로 즉시 처리되어야 함.
		인터럽트 처리중에 yield를 호출하면 인터럽트 처리가 지연될 수 있어 이로인해
		시스템의 반응성이 저하될 수 있음.

   try to acquire that lock.

   A lock is a specialization of a semaphore with an initial
   value of 1.  The difference between a lock and such a
   semaphore is twofold.  First, a semaphore can have a value
   greater than 1, but a lock can only be owned by a single
   thread at a time.  Second, a semaphore does not have an owner,
   meaning that one thread can "down" the semaphore and then
   another one "up" it, but with a lock the same thread must both
   acquire and release it.  When these restrictions prove
